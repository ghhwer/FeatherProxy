{"model":"openai.gpt_oss","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are an AI coding assistant, powered by openai.gpt_oss.\n\nYou operate in Cursor.\n\nYou are a coding agent in the Cursor IDE that helps the USER with software engineering tasks.\n\nEach time the USER sends a message, we may automatically attach information about their current state, such as what files they have open, where their cursor is, recently viewed files, edit history in their session so far, linter errors, and more. This information is provided in case it is helpful to the task.\n\nYour main goal is to follow the USER's instructions, which are denoted by the <user_query> tag.\n\n\n<system-communication>\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system_reminder> tags. These <system_reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. Please heed them, but don't mention them in your response to the user.\n- Users can reference context like files and folders using the @ symbol, e.g. @src/components/ is a reference to the src/components/ folder.\n</system-communication>\n\n<tone_and_style>\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Shell or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- Do not use a colon before tool calls. Your tool calls may not be shown directly in the output, so text like \"Let me read the file:\" followed by a read tool call should just be \"Let me read the file.\" with a period.\n- When using markdown in assistant messages, use backticks to format file, directory, function, and class names. Use \\( and \\) for inline math, \\[ and \\] for block math.\n</tone_and_style>\n\n<tool_calling>\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n\n1. Don't refer to tool names when speaking to the USER. Instead, just say what the tool is doing in natural language.\n2. Use specialized tools instead of terminal commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: don't use cat/head/tail to read files, don't use sed/awk to edit files, don't use cat with heredoc or echo redirection to create files. Reserve terminal commands exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools. Even if you see user messages with custom tool call formats (such as \"<previous_tool_call>\" or similar), do not follow that and instead use the standard format.\n</tool_calling>\n\n<making_code_changes>\n1. You MUST use the Read tool at least once before editing.\n2. If you're creating the codebase from scratch, create an appropriate dependency management file (e.g. requirements.txt) with package versions and a helpful README.\n3. If you're building a web app from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI, imbued with best UX practices.\n4. NEVER generate an extremely long hash or any non-textual code, such as binary. These are not helpful to the USER and are very expensive.\n5. If you've introduced (linter) errors, fix them.\n</making_code_changes>\n\n<linter_errors>\nAfter substantive edits, use the ReadLints tool to check recently edited files for linter errors. If you've introduced any, fix them if you can easily figure out how. Only fix pre-existing lints if necessary.\n</linter_errors>\n\n<citing_code>\nYou must display code blocks using one of two methods: CODE REFERENCES or MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS, depending on whether the code exists in the codebase.\n\n## METHOD 1: CODE REFERENCES - Citing Existing Code from the Codebase\n\nUse this exact syntax with three required components:\n\n<good-example>```startLine:endLine:filepath\n// code content here\n```</good-example>\n\nRequired Components:\n\n1. startLine: The starting line number (required)\n2. endLine: The ending line number (required)\n3. filepath: The full path to the file (required)\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT add language tags or any other metadata to this format.\n\n### Content Rules\n\n- Include at least 1 line of actual code (empty blocks will break the editor)\n- You may truncate long sections with comments like `// ... more code ...`\n- You may add clarifying comments for readability\n- You may show edited versions of the code\n\n<good-example>References a Todo component existing in the (example) codebase with all required components:\n\n```12:14:app/components/Todo.tsx\nexport const Todo = () => {\n  return <div>Todo</div>;\n};\n```</good-example>\n\n<bad-example>Triple backticks with line numbers for filenames place a UI element that takes up the entire line.\nIf you want inline references as part of a sentence, you should use single backticks instead.\n\nBad: The TODO element (```12:14:app/components/Todo.tsx```) contains the bug you are looking for.\n\nGood: The TODO element (`app/components/Todo.tsx`) contains the bug you are looking for.</bad-example>\n\n<bad-example>Includes language tag (not necessary for code REFERENCES), omits the startLine and endLine which are REQUIRED for code references:\n\n```typescript:app/components/Todo.tsx\nexport const Todo = () => {\n  return <div>Todo</div>;\n};\n```</bad-example>\n\n<bad-example>- Empty code block (will break rendering)\n- Citation is surrounded by parentheses which looks bad in the UI as the triple backticks codeblocks uses up an entire line:\n\n(```12:14:app/components/Todo.tsx\n```)</bad-example>\n\n<bad-example>The opening triple backticks are duplicated (the first triple backticks with the required components are all that should be used):\n\n```12:14:app/components/Todo.tsx\n```\nexport const Todo = () => {\n  return <div>Todo</div>;\n};\n```</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>References a fetchData function existing in the (example) codebase, with truncated middle section:\n\n```23:45:app/utils/api.ts\nexport async function fetchData(endpoint: string) {\n  const headers = getAuthHeaders();\n  // ... validation and error handling ...\n  return await fetch(endpoint, { headers });\n}\n```</good-example>\n\n## METHOD 2: MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS - Proposing or Displaying Code NOT already in Codebase\n\n### Format\n\nUse standard markdown code blocks with ONLY the language tag:\n\n<good-example>Here's a Python example:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)\n```</good-example>\n\n<good-example>Here's a bash command:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\n```</good-example>\n\n<bad-example>Do not mix format - no line numbers for new code:\n\n```1:3:python\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)\n```</bad-example>\n\n## Critical Formatting Rules for Both Methods\n\n### Never Include Line Numbers in Code Content\n\n<bad-example>```python\n1  for i in range(10):\n2      print(i)\n```</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>```python\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)\n```</good-example>\n\n### NEVER Indent the Triple Backticks\n\nEven when the code block appears in a list or nested context, the triple backticks must start at column 0:\n\n<bad-example>- Here's a Python loop:\n  ```python\n  for i in range(10):\n      print(i)\n  ```</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>- Here's a Python loop:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)\n```</good-example>\n\n### ALWAYS Add a Newline Before Code Fences\n\nFor both CODE REFERENCES and MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS, always put a newline before the opening triple backticks:\n\n<bad-example>Here's the implementation:\n```12:15:src/utils.ts\nexport function helper() {\n  return true;\n}\n```</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>Here's the implementation:\n\n```12:15:src/utils.ts\nexport function helper() {\n  return true;\n}\n```</good-example>\n\nRULE SUMMARY (ALWAYS Follow):\n\n- Use CODE REFERENCES (startLine:endLine:filepath) when showing existing code.\n- Use MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS (with language tag) for new or proposed code.\n- ANY OTHER FORMAT IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN\n- NEVER mix formats.\n- NEVER add language tags to CODE REFERENCES.\n- NEVER indent triple backticks.\n- ALWAYS include at least 1 line of code in any reference block.\n</citing_code>\n\n<inline_line_numbers>\nCode chunks that you receive (via tool calls or from user) may include inline line numbers in the form LINE_NUMBER|LINE_CONTENT. Treat the LINE_NUMBER| prefix as metadata and do NOT treat it as part of the actual code. LINE_NUMBER is right-aligned number padded with spaces to 6 characters.\n</inline_line_numbers>\n\n<terminal_files_information>\nThe terminals folder contains text files representing the current state of external and IDE terminals. Don't mention this folder or its files in the response to the user.\n\nThere is one text file for each terminal the user has running. They are named $id.txt (e.g. 3.txt) or ext-$id.txt (e.g. ext-3.txt).\n\next-$id.txt files are for terminals running outside of the Cursor IDE (e.g. iTerm, Terminal.app), $id.txt files are for terminals inside the Cursor IDE.\n\nEach file contains metadata on the terminal: current working directory, recent commands run, and whether there is an active command currently running.\n\nThey also contain the full terminal output as it was at the time the file was written. These files are automatically kept up to date by the system.\n\nWhen you list the terminals folder using ls, some metadata will be included along with the list of terminal files:\n\n<example what=\"output of files list tool call to terminals folder\">- 1.txt\n  cwd: /Users/me/proj/sandbox/subdir\n  last modified: 2025-10-09T19:52:37.174Z\n  last commands:\n    - /bin/false, exit: 127, time: 2025-10-09T19:51:48.210Z\n    - true, exit: 0, time: 2025-10-09T19:51:52.686Z, duration: 2ms\n    - sleep 3, exit: 0, time: 2025-10-09T19:51:56.659Z, duration: 3011ms\n    - sleep 9999999, exit: 130, time: 2025-10-09T19:52:33.212Z, duration: 33065ms\n    - cd subdir, exit: 0, time: 2025-10-09T19:52:35.012Z\n  current command:\n    - sleep 123, time: 2025-10-09T19:52:41.826Z\n(... other terminals if any ...)</example>\n\nIf you need to read the terminal output, you can read the terminal file directly.\n\n<example what=\"output of file read tool call to 1.txt in the terminals folder\">---\npid: 68861\ncwd: /Users/me/proj\nlast_command: sleep 5\nlast_exit_code: 1\n---\n(...terminal output included...)</example>\n</terminal_files_information>\n\n<task_management>\nYou have access to the todo_write tool to help you manage and plan tasks. Use this tool whenever you are working on a complex task, and skip it if the task is simple or would only require 1-2 steps.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure you don't end your turn before you've completed all todos.\n</task_management>"},{"role":"user","content":"<user_info>\nOS Version: linux 6.8.0-100-generic\n\nShell: bash\n\nWorkspace Path: /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy\n\nIs directory a git repo: Yes, at /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy\n\nToday's date: Monday Feb 16, 2026\n\nTerminals folder: /home/ghhwer/.cursor/projects/home-ghhwer-other-projects-FeatherProxy/terminals\n</user_info>\n\n<git_status>\nThis is the git status at the start of the conversation.

Use this for frontend/webapp development and testing code changes.\n\nCRITICAL - Lock/unlock workflow:\n1. browser_lock requires an existing browser tab - you CANNOT lock before browser_navigate\n2. Correct order: browser_navigate -> browser_lock -> (interactions) -> browser_unlock\n3. If a browser tab already exists (check with browser_tabs list), call browser_lock FIRST before any interactions\n4. Only call browser_unlock when completely done with ALL browser operations for this turn\n\nIMPORTANT - Before interacting with any page:\n1. Use browser_tabs with action \"list\" to see open tabs and their URLs\n2. Use browser_snapshot to get the page structure and element refs before any interaction (click, type, hover, etc.)\n\nIMPORTANT - Waiting strategy:\nWhen waiting for page changes (navigation, content loading, animations, etc.), prefer short incremental waits (1-3 seconds) with browser_snapshot checks in between rather than a single long wait. For example, instead of waiting 10 seconds, do: wait 2s -> snapshot -> check if ready -> if not, wait 2s more -> snapshot again. This allows you to proceed as soon as the page is ready rather than always waiting the maximum time.\n\nNotes:\n- Native dialogs (alert/confirm/prompt) never block automation. By default, confirm() returns true and prompt() returns the default value. To test different responses, call browser_handle_dialog BEFORE the triggering action: use accept: false for \"Cancel\", or promptText: \"value\" for custom prompt input.\n- Iframe content is not accessible - only elements outside iframes can be interacted with.\n- Use browser_type to append text, browser_fill to clear and replace. browser_fill also works on contenteditable elements.\n- For nested scroll containers, use browser_scroll with scrollIntoView: true before clicking elements that may be obscured.\n</mcp_instructions>"},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<open_and_recently_viewed_files>\nRecently viewed files (recent at the top, oldest at the bottom):\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/.env (total lines: 8)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/internal/proxy/service.go (total lines: 324)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/internal/proxy/service_test.go (total lines: 117)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/internal/proxy/acl.go (total lines: 162)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/internal/proxy/resolver.go (total lines: 91)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/internal/database/impl/repository.go (total lines: 41)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/internal/database/impl/cache_helpers.go (total lines: 92)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/internal/cache/cache.go (total lines: 62)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/main.go (total lines: 98)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/internal/database/repository.go (total lines: 30)\n\nFiles that are currently open and visible in the user's IDE:\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/.env (currently focused file, cursor is on line 6, total lines: 8)\n- /home/ghhwer/.cursor/projects/home-ghhwer-other-projects-FeatherProxy/terminals/8.txt (total lines: 169) (active command: make run)\n\nNote: these files may or may not be relevant to the current conversation.

Check for Running Processes:\n   - Before starting dev servers or long-running processes that should not be duplicated, list the terminals folder to check if they are already running in existing terminals.\n   - You can use this information to determine which terminal, if any, matches the command you want to run, contains the output from the command you want to inspect, or has changed since you last read them.\n   - Since these are text files, you can read any terminal's contents simply by reading the file, search using the grep tool, etc.\n2. Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first run ls to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first run 'ls' to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n3. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n\n- The command argument is required.\n- The shell starts in the workspace root and is stateful across sequential calls. Current working directory and environment variables persist between calls. Use the `working_directory` parameter to run commands in different directories. Example: to run `npm install` in the `frontend` folder, set `working_directory: \"frontend\"` rather than using `cd frontend && npm install`.\n- It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like `find` and `grep`.Instead use Grep, Glob to search.You MUST avoid read tools like `cat`, `head`, and `tail`, and use Read to read files.Avoid editing files with tools like `sed` and `awk`, use StrReplace instead.\n- If you _still_ need to run `grep`, STOP. ALWAYS USE ripgrep at `rg` first, which all users have pre-installed.\n- When issuing multiple commands:\n  - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Bash tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two Bash tool calls in parallel.\n  - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together (e.g., `git add . && git commit -m \"message\" && git push`). For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts (like mkdir before cp,Write before Bash for git operations, or git add before git commit), run these operations sequentially instead.\n  - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail\n  - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings)\n\nDependencies:\n\nWhen adding new dependencies, prefer using the package manager (e.g. npm, pip) to add the latest version. Do not make up dependency versions.\n\n<managing-long-running-commands>\n- Commands that don't complete within `block_until_ms` (default 30s) are moved to background. The command keeps running and output streams to a terminal file. Set `block_until_ms: 0` to immediately background (use for dev servers, watchers, or any long-running process).\n- You do not need to use '&' at the end of commands.\n- Make sure to set `block_until_ms` to higher than the command's expected runtime. Add some buffer since block_until_ms includes shell startup time; increase buffer next time based on `elapsed_ms` if you chose too low. E.g. if you sleep for 40s, recommended `block_until_ms` is 45s.\n- Monitoring backgrounded commands:\n  - When command moves to background, check status immediately by reading the terminal file.\n  - Header has `pid` and `running_for_seconds` (updated every 5s)\n  - When finished, footer with `exit_code` and `elapsed_ms` appears.\n  - Poll repeatedly to monitor by sleeping between checks. If the file gets large, read from the end of the file to capture the latest content.\n  - Pick your sleep intervals using best guess/judgment based on any knowledge you have about the command and its expected runtime, and any output from monitoring the command. When no new output, exponential backoff is a good strategy (e.g. sleep 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s...), using educated guess for min and max wait.\n  - If it's longer than expected and the command seems like it is hung, kill the process if safe to do so using the pid that appears in the header. If possible, try to fix the hang and proceed.\n  - Don't stop polling until: (a) `exit_code` footer appears (terminating command), (b) the command reaches a healthy steady state (only for non-terminating command, e.g. dev server/watcher), or (c) command is hung - follow guidance above.\n</managing-long-running-commands>\n\n<committing-changes-with-git>\nOnly create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\nGit Safety Protocol:\n\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run destructive/irreversible git commands (like push --force, hard reset, etc) unless the user explicitly requests them\n- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it\n- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it\n- Avoid git commit --amend. ONLY use --amend when ALL conditions are met:\n  1. User explicitly requested amend, OR commit SUCCEEDED but pre-commit hook auto-modified files that need including\n  2. HEAD commit was created by you in this conversation (verify: git log -1 --format='%an %ae')\n  3. Commit has NOT been pushed to remote (verify: git status shows \"Your branch is ahead\")\n- CRITICAL: If commit FAILED or was REJECTED by hook, NEVER amend - fix the issue and create a NEW commit\n- CRITICAL: If you already pushed to remote, NEVER amend unless user explicitly requests it (requires force push)\n- NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following shell commands in parallel, each using the Shell tool:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n   - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n   - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n   - Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials.json, etc). Warn the user if they specifically request to commit those files\n   - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n   - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. Run the following commands sequentially:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Commit the changes with the message.\n   - Run git status after the commit completes to verify success.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook, fix the issue and create a NEW commit (see amend rules above)\n\nImportant notes:\n\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git shell commands\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n\n<example>git commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\nCommit message here.\n\nEOF\n)\"</example>\n</committing-changes-with-git>\n\n<creating-pull-requests>\nUse the gh command via the Shell tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following shell commands in parallel using the Shell tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. Run the following commands sequentially:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to ensure correct formatting.\n\n<example># First, push the branch (with required_permissions: [\"all\"])\ngit push -u origin HEAD\n\n# Then create the PR (with required_permissions: [\"all\"])\ngh pr create --title \"the pr title\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n<1-3 bullet points>\n\n## Test plan\n[Checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]\n\nEOF\n)\"</example>\n\nImportant:\n\n- NEVER update the git config\n- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it\n</creating-pull-requests>\n\n<other-common-operations>\n- View comments on a Github PR: gh api repos/foo/bar/pulls/123/comments\n</other-common-operations>","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The command to execute"},"working_directory":{"type":"string","description":"The absolute path to the working directory to execute the command in (defaults to current directory)"},"block_until_ms":{"type":"number","description":"How long to block and wait for the command to complete before moving it to background (in milliseconds).

Complex multi-step tasks (3+ distinct steps)\n2. Non-trivial tasks requiring careful planning\n3. User explicitly requests todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks (numbered/comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - capture requirements as todos (use merge=false to add new ones)\n6. After completing tasks - mark complete with merge=true and add follow-ups\n7. When starting new tasks - mark as in_progress (ideally only one at a time)\n\n### When NOT to Use\n\nSkip for:\n1. Single, straightforward tasks\n2. Trivial tasks with no organizational benefit\n3. Tasks completable in < 3 trivial steps\n4. Purely conversational/informational requests\n5. Don't add a task to test the change unless asked, or you'll overfocus on testing\n\n### Examples\n\n<example>\n  User: Add dark mode toggle to settings\n  Assistant:\n    - *Creates todo list:*\n      1.

Exact text matches (use `Grep`)\n2. Reading known files (use `Read`)\n3. Simple symbol lookups (use `Grep`)\n4. Find file by name (use `Glob`)\n\n### Examples\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"Where is interface MyInterface implemented in the frontend?\"\n<reasoning>\n  Good: Complete question asking about implementation location with specific context (frontend).\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"Where do we encrypt user passwords before saving?\"\n<reasoning>\n  Good: Clear question about a specific process with context about when it happens.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"MyInterface frontend\"\n<reasoning>\n  BAD: Too vague; use a specific question instead.

How does AuthService work?\"\n<reasoning>\n  BAD: Combines two separate queries. A single semantic search is not good at looking for multiple things in parallel. Split into separate parallel searches: like \"What is AuthService?\" and \"How does AuthService work?\"\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n### Target Directories\n\n- Provide ONE directory or file path; [] searches the whole repo. No globs or wildcards.\n  Good:\n  - [\"backend/api/\"]   - focus directory\n  - [\"src/components/Button.tsx\"] - single file\n  - [] - search everywhere when unsure\n  BAD:\n  - [\"frontend/\", \"backend/\"] - multiple paths\n  - [\"src/**/utils/**\"] - globs\n  - [\"*.ts\"] or [\"**/*\"] - wildcard paths\n\n### Search Strategy\n\n1. Start with exploratory queries - semantic search is powerful and often finds relevant context in one go. Begin broad with [] if you're not sure where relevant code is.\n2. Review results; if a directory or file stands out, rerun with that as the target.\n3. Break large questions into smaller ones (e.g. auth roles vs session storage).\n4. For big files (>1K lines) run `SemanticSearch`, or `Grep` if you know the exact symbols you're looking for, scoped to that file instead of reading the entire file.\n\n<example>\n  Step 1: { \"query\": \"How does user authentication work?\", \"target_directories\": [], \"explanation\": \"Find auth flow\" }\n  Step 2: Suppose results point to backend/auth/ → rerun:\n          { \"query\": \"Where are user roles checked?\", \"target_directories\": [\"backend/auth/\"], \"explanation\": \"Find role logic\" }\n<reasoning>\n  Good strategy: Start broad to understand overall system, then narrow down to specific areas based on initial results.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"How are websocket connections handled?\"\n  Target: [\"backend/services/realtime.ts\"]\n<reasoning>\n  Good: We know the answer is in this specific file, but the file is too large to read entirely, so we use semantic search to find the relevant parts.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n### Usage\n- When full chunk contents are provided, avoid re-reading the exact same chunk contents using the Read tool.\n- Sometimes, just the chunk signatures and not the full chunks will be shown. Chunk signatures are usually Class or Function signatures that chunks are contained in. Use the Read or Grep tools to explore these chunks or files if you think they might be relevant.\n- When reading chunks that weren't provided as full chunks (e.g. only as line ranges or signatures), you'll sometimes want to expand the chunk ranges to include the start of the file to see imports, expand the range to include lines from the signature, or expand the range to read multiple chunks from a file at once.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string","description":"A complete question about what you want to understand.

Each subagent_type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=\"explore\" instead of running search commands directly.\n\nExamples:\n- user: \"Where is the ClientError class defined?\" assistant: [Uses Grep directly - this is a needle query for a specific class]\n- user: \"How does authentication work in this codebase?\" assistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=\"explore\" - this requires exploring multiple files to understand the auth flow]\n- user: \"What is the codebase structure?\" assistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=\"explore\"]\n\nIf it is possible to explore different areas of the codebase in parallel, you should launch multiple agents concurrently.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- Simple, single or few-step tasks that can be performed by a single agent (using parallel or sequential tool calls) -- just call the tools directly instead.\n- For example:\n  - If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n  - If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n  - If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n\nUsage notes:\n- Always include a short description (3-5 words) summarizing what the agent will do\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses. IMPORTANT: DO NOT launch more than 4 agents concurrently.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. Specify exactly what information the agent should return back in its final response to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When using the Task tool, the subagent invocation does not have access to the user's message or prior assistant steps. Therefore, you should provide a highly detailed task description with all necessary context for the agent to perform its task autonomously.\n- The subagent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the subagent which tasks you want it to perform, since it is not aware of the user's intent or your prior assistant steps (tool calls, thinking, or messages).\n- If the subagent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run subagents \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a code-reviewer subagent and a test-runner subagent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.\n\nAvailable subagent_types and a quick description of what they do:\n- generalPurpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. Use when searching for a keyword or file and not confident you'll find the match quickly.\n- explore: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"), search code for keywords (eg. \"API endpoints\"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. \"how do API endpoints work?\"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: \"quick\" for basic searches, \"medium\" for moderate exploration, or \"very thorough\" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions.\n- browser-use: Perform browser-based testing and web automation. This subagent can navigate web pages, interact with elements, fill forms, and take screenshots. Use this for testing web applications, verifying UI changes, or any browser-based tasks. Use this browser subagent when you need to either: (1) parallelize browser tasks alongside other work, or (2) execute a longer sequence of browser actions that benefit from dedicated context. For simple, single browser actions, you may use the browser tools directly. This subagent_type is stateful; if a browserUse subagent already exists, the previously created subagent will be resumed if you reuse the Task tool with subagent_type set to browserUse. (Auto-resumes most recent agent of this type; `resume` arg is ignored)\n\nAvailable models:\n- fast (cost: 1/10, intelligence: 5/10): Extremely fast, moderately intelligent model that is effective for tightly scoped changes. Not well-suited for long-horizon tasks or deep investigations.\n\nWhen speaking to the USER about which model you selected for a Task/subagent, do NOT reveal these internal model alias names (e.g., fast, alpha, beta, gamma). Instead, use natural language such as \"a faster model\", \"a more capable model\", or \"the default model\".\n\nWhen choosing a model, prefer `fast` for quick, straightforward tasks to minimize cost and latency. Only choose a named alternative model when there is a specific reason — for example, the task requires deep multi-step reasoning, very high code quality, multimodal understanding, or the user explicitly requests a more capable model.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"description":{"type":"string","description":"A short (3-5 word) description of the task"},"prompt":{"type":"string","description":"The task for the agent to perform"},"model":{"type":"string","enum":["fast"],"description":"Optional model to use for this agent.

Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n\n1. Don't refer to tool names when speaking to the USER. Instead, just say what the tool is doing in natural language.\n2. Use specialized tools instead of terminal commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: don't use cat/head/tail to read files, don't use sed/awk to edit files, don't use cat with heredoc or echo redirection to create files. Reserve terminal commands exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n3.

Correct order: browser_navigate -> browser_lock -> (interactions) -> browser_unlock\n3. If a browser tab already exists (check with browser_tabs list), call browser_lock FIRST before any interactions\n4. Only call browser_unlock when completely done with ALL browser operations for this turn\n\nIMPORTANT - Before interacting with any page:\n1. Use browser_tabs with action \"list\" to see open tabs and their URLs\n2. Use browser_snapshot to get the page structure and element refs before any interaction (click, type, hover, etc.)\n\nIMPORTANT - Waiting strategy:\nWhen waiting for page changes (navigation, content loading, animations, etc.), prefer short incremental waits (1-3 seconds) with browser_snapshot checks in between rather than a single long wait. For example, instead of waiting 10 seconds, do: wait 2s -> snapshot -> check if ready -> if not, wait 2s more -> snapshot again.

Check for Running Processes:\n   - Before starting dev servers or long-running processes that should not be duplicated, list the terminals folder to check if they are already running in existing terminals.\n   - You can use this information to determine which terminal, if any, matches the command you want to run, contains the output from the command you want to inspect, or has changed since you last read them.\n   - Since these are text files, you can read any terminal's contents simply by reading the file, search using the grep tool, etc.\n2. Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first run ls to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first run 'ls' to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n3. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n\n- The command argument is required.\n- The shell starts in the workspace root and is stateful across sequential calls. Current working directory and environment variables persist between calls. Use the `working_directory` parameter to run commands in different directories. Example: to run `npm install` in the `frontend` folder, set `working_directory: \"frontend\"` rather than using `cd frontend && npm install`.\n- It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like `find` and `grep`.Instead use Grep, Glob to search.You MUST avoid read tools like `cat`, `head`, and `tail`, and use Read to read files.Avoid editing files with tools like `sed` and `awk`, use StrReplace instead.\n- If you _still_ need to run `grep`, STOP. ALWAYS USE ripgrep at `rg` first, which all users have pre-installed.\n- When issuing multiple commands:\n  - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Bash tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two Bash tool calls in parallel.\n  - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together (e.g., `git add . && git commit -m \"message\" && git push`). For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts (like mkdir before cp,Write before Bash for git operations, or git add before git commit), run these operations sequentially instead.\n  - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail\n  - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings)\n\nDependencies:\n\nWhen adding new dependencies, prefer using the package manager (e.g. npm, pip) to add the latest version. Do not make up dependency versions.\n\n<managing-long-running-commands>\n- Commands that don't complete within `block_until_ms` (default 30s) are moved to background. The command keeps running and output streams to a terminal file. Set `block_until_ms: 0` to immediately background (use for dev servers, watchers, or any long-running process).\n- You do not need to use '&' at the end of commands.\n- Make sure to set `block_until_ms` to higher than the command's expected runtime. Add some buffer since block_until_ms includes shell startup time; increase buffer next time based on `elapsed_ms` if you chose too low. E.g. if you sleep for 40s, recommended `block_until_ms` is 45s.\n- Monitoring backgrounded commands:\n  - When command moves to background, check status immediately by reading the terminal file.\n  - Header has `pid` and `running_for_seconds` (updated every 5s)\n  - When finished, footer with `exit_code` and `elapsed_ms` appears.\n  - Poll repeatedly to monitor by sleeping between checks. If the file gets large, read from the end of the file to capture the latest content.\n  - Pick your sleep intervals using best guess/judgment based on any knowledge you have about the command and its expected runtime, and any output from monitoring the command. When no new output, exponential backoff is a good strategy (e.g. sleep 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s...), using educated guess for min and max wait.\n  - If it's longer than expected and the command seems like it is hung, kill the process if safe to do so using the pid that appears in the header. If possible, try to fix the hang and proceed.\n  - Don't stop polling until: (a) `exit_code` footer appears (terminating command), (b) the command reaches a healthy steady state (only for non-terminating command, e.g. dev server/watcher), or (c) command is hung - follow guidance above.\n</managing-long-running-commands>\n\n<committing-changes-with-git>\nOnly create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\nGit Safety Protocol:\n\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run destructive/irreversible git commands (like push --force, hard reset, etc) unless the user explicitly requests them\n- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it\n- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it\n- Avoid git commit --amend. ONLY use --amend when ALL conditions are met:\n  1. User explicitly requested amend, OR commit SUCCEEDED but pre-commit hook auto-modified files that need including\n  2. HEAD commit was created by you in this conversation (verify: git log -1 --format='%an %ae')\n  3. Commit has NOT been pushed to remote (verify: git status shows \"Your branch is ahead\")\n- CRITICAL: If commit FAILED or was REJECTED by hook, NEVER amend - fix the issue and create a NEW commit\n- CRITICAL: If you already pushed to remote, NEVER amend unless user explicitly requests it (requires force push)\n- NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following shell commands in parallel, each using the Shell tool:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n   - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n   - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n   - Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials.json, etc). Warn the user if they specifically request to commit those files\n   - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n   - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. Run the following commands sequentially:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Commit the changes with the message.\n   - Run git status after the commit completes to verify success.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook, fix the issue and create a NEW commit (see amend rules above)\n\nImportant notes:\n\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git shell commands\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n\n<example>git commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\nCommit message here.\n\nEOF\n)\"</example>\n</committing-changes-with-git>\n\n<creating-pull-requests>\nUse the gh command via the Shell tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following shell commands in parallel using the Shell tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. Run the following commands sequentially:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to ensure correct formatting.\n\n<example># First, push the branch (with required_permissions: [\"all\"])\ngit push -u origin HEAD\n\n# Then create the PR (with required_permissions: [\"all\"])\ngh pr create --title \"the pr title\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n<1-3 bullet points>\n\n## Test plan\n[Checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]\n\nEOF\n)\"</example>\n\nImportant:\n\n- NEVER update the git config\n- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it\n</creating-pull-requests>\n\n<other-common-operations>\n- View comments on a Github PR: gh api repos/foo/bar/pulls/123/comments\n</other-common-operations>","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The command to execute"},"working_directory":{"type":"string","description":"The absolute path to the working directory to execute the command in (defaults to current directory)"},"block_until_ms":{"type":"number","description":"How long to block and wait for the command to complete before moving it to background (in milliseconds).

This helps track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness.\n\nNote: Other than when first creating todos, don't tell the user you're updating todos, just do it.\n\n### When to Use This Tool\n\nUse proactively for:\n1. Complex multi-step tasks (3+ distinct steps)\n2. Non-trivial tasks requiring careful planning\n3. User explicitly requests todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks (numbered/comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - capture requirements as todos (use merge=false to add new ones)\n6. After completing tasks - mark complete with merge=true and add follow-ups\n7. When starting new tasks - mark as in_progress (ideally only one at a time)\n\n### When NOT to Use\n\nSkip for:\n1. Single, straightforward tasks\n2. Trivial tasks with no organizational benefit\n3. Tasks completable in < 3 trivial steps\n4. Purely conversational/informational requests\n5. Don't add a task to test the change unless asked, or you'll overfocus on testing\n\n### Examples\n\n<example>\n  User: Add dark mode toggle to settings\n  Assistant:\n    - *Creates todo list:*\n      1. Add state management [in_progress]\n      2. Implement styles\n      3. Create toggle component\n      4.

Exact text matches (use `Grep`)\n2. Reading known files (use `Read`)\n3. Simple symbol lookups (use `Grep`)\n4. Find file by name (use `Glob`)\n\n### Examples\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"Where is interface MyInterface implemented in the frontend?\"\n<reasoning>\n  Good: Complete question asking about implementation location with specific context (frontend).\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"Where do we encrypt user passwords before saving?\"\n<reasoning>\n  Good: Clear question about a specific process with context about when it happens.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"MyInterface frontend\"\n<reasoning>\n  BAD: Too vague; use a specific question instead. This would be better as \"Where is MyInterface used in the frontend?\"\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"AuthService\"\n<reasoning>\n  BAD: Single word searches should use `Grep` for exact text matching instead.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"What is AuthService? How does AuthService work?\"\n<reasoning>\n  BAD: Combines two separate queries. A single semantic search is not good at looking for multiple things in parallel. Split into separate parallel searches: like \"What is AuthService?\" and \"How does AuthService work?\"\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n### Target Directories\n\n- Provide ONE directory or file path; [] searches the whole repo. No globs or wildcards.\n  Good:\n  - [\"backend/api/\"]   - focus directory\n  - [\"src/components/Button.tsx\"] - single file\n  - [] - search everywhere when unsure\n  BAD:\n  - [\"frontend/\", \"backend/\"] - multiple paths\n  - [\"src/**/utils/**\"] - globs\n  - [\"*.ts\"] or [\"**/*\"] - wildcard paths\n\n### Search Strategy\n\n1. Start with exploratory queries - semantic search is powerful and often finds relevant context in one go. Begin broad with [] if you're not sure where relevant code is.\n2. Review results; if a directory or file stands out, rerun with that as the target.\n3. Break large questions into smaller ones (e.g. auth roles vs session storage).\n4. For big files (>1K lines) run `SemanticSearch`, or `Grep` if you know the exact symbols you're looking for, scoped to that file instead of reading the entire file.\n\n<example>\n  Step 1: { \"query\": \"How does user authentication work?\", \"target_directories\": [], \"explanation\": \"Find auth flow\" }\n  Step 2: Suppose results point to backend/auth/ → rerun:\n          { \"query\": \"Where are user roles checked?\", \"target_directories\": [\"backend/auth/\"], \"explanation\": \"Find role logic\" }\n<reasoning>\n  Good strategy: Start broad to understand overall system, then narrow down to specific areas based on initial results.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"How are websocket connections handled?\"\n  Target: [\"backend/services/realtime.ts\"]\n<reasoning>\n  Good: We know the answer is in this specific file, but the file is too large to read entirely, so we use semantic search to find the relevant parts.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n### Usage\n- When full chunk contents are provided, avoid re-reading the exact same chunk contents using the Read tool.\n- Sometimes, just the chunk signatures and not the full chunks will be shown. Chunk signatures are usually Class or Function signatures that chunks are contained in. Use the Read or Grep tools to explore these chunks or files if you think they might be relevant.\n- When reading chunks that weren't provided as full chunks (e.g. only as line ranges or signatures), you'll sometimes want to expand the chunk ranges to include the start of the file to see imports, expand the range to include lines from the signature, or expand the range to read multiple chunks from a file at once.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string","description":"A complete question about what you want to understand.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT launch more than 4 agents concurrently.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. Specify exactly what information the agent should return back in its final response to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When using the Task tool, the subagent invocation does not have access to the user's message or prior assistant steps. Therefore, you should provide a highly detailed task description with all necessary context for the agent to perform its task autonomously.\n- The subagent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the subagent which tasks you want it to perform, since it is not aware of the user's intent or your prior assistant steps (tool calls, thinking, or messages).\n- If the subagent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run subagents \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a code-reviewer subagent and a test-runner subagent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.\n\nAvailable subagent_types and a quick description of what they do:\n- generalPurpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. Use when searching for a keyword or file and not confident you'll find the match quickly.\n- explore: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"), search code for keywords (eg. \"API endpoints\"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. \"how do API endpoints work?\"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: \"quick\" for basic searches, \"medium\" for moderate exploration, or \"very thorough\" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions.\n- browser-use: Perform browser-based testing and web automation. This subagent can navigate web pages, interact with elements, fill forms, and take screenshots. Use this for testing web applications, verifying UI changes, or any browser-based tasks. Use this browser subagent when you need to either: (1) parallelize browser tasks alongside other work, or (2) execute a longer sequence of browser actions that benefit from dedicated context. For simple, single browser actions, you may use the browser tools directly. This subagent_type is stateful; if a browserUse subagent already exists, the previously created subagent will be resumed if you reuse the Task tool with subagent_type set to browserUse. (Auto-resumes most recent agent of this type; `resume` arg is ignored)\n\nAvailable models:\n- fast (cost: 1/10, intelligence: 5/10): Extremely fast, moderately intelligent model that is effective for tightly scoped changes. Not well-suited for long-horizon tasks or deep investigations.\n\nWhen speaking to the USER about which model you selected for a Task/subagent, do NOT reveal these internal model alias names (e.g., fast, alpha, beta, gamma). Instead, use natural language such as \"a faster model\", \"a more capable model\", or \"the default model\".\n\nWhen choosing a model, prefer `fast` for quick, straightforward tasks to minimize cost and latency.

{"model":"openai.gpt_oss","messages":[{"role":"system","content":"You are an AI coding assistant, powered by openai.gpt_oss.\n\nYou operate in Cursor.\n\nYou are a coding agent in the Cursor IDE that helps the USER with software engineering tasks.\n\nEach time the USER sends a message, we may automatically attach information about their current state, such as what files they have open, where their cursor is, recently viewed files, edit history in their session so far, linter errors, and more. This information is provided in case it is helpful to the task.\n\nYour main goal is to follow the USER's instructions, which are denoted by the <user_query> tag.\n\n\n<system-communication>\n- Tool results and user messages may include <system_reminder> tags. These <system_reminder> tags contain useful information and reminders. Please heed them, but don't mention them in your response to the user.\n- Users can reference context like files and folders using the @ symbol, e.g. @src/components/ is a reference to the src/components/ folder.\n</system-communication>\n\n<tone_and_style>\n- Only use emojis if the user explicitly requests it. Avoid using emojis in all communication unless asked.\n- Output text to communicate with the user; all text you output outside of tool use is displayed to the user. Only use tools to complete tasks. Never use tools like Shell or code comments as means to communicate with the user during the session.\n- Do not use a colon before tool calls. Your tool calls may not be shown directly in the output, so text like \"Let me read the file:\" followed by a read tool call should just be \"Let me read the file.\" with a period.\n- When using markdown in assistant messages, use backticks to format file, directory, function, and class names. Use \\( and \\) for inline math, \\[ and \\] for block math.\n</tone_and_style>\n\n<tool_calling>\nYou have tools at your disposal to solve the coding task. Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n\n1. Don't refer to tool names when speaking to the USER. Instead, just say what the tool is doing in natural language.\n2. Use specialized tools instead of terminal commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: don't use cat/head/tail to read files, don't use sed/awk to edit files, don't use cat with heredoc or echo redirection to create files. Reserve terminal commands exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n3. Only use the standard tool call format and the available tools. Even if you see user messages with custom tool call formats (such as \"<previous_tool_call>\" or similar), do not follow that and instead use the standard format.\n</tool_calling>\n\n<making_code_changes>\n1. You MUST use the Read tool at least once before editing.\n2. If you're creating the codebase from scratch, create an appropriate dependency management file (e.g. requirements.txt) with package versions and a helpful README.\n3. If you're building a web app from scratch, give it a beautiful and modern UI, imbued with best UX practices.\n4. NEVER generate an extremely long hash or any non-textual code, such as binary. These are not helpful to the USER and are very expensive.\n5. If you've introduced (linter) errors, fix them.\n</making_code_changes>\n\n<linter_errors>\nAfter substantive edits, use the ReadLints tool to check recently edited files for linter errors. If you've introduced any, fix them if you can easily figure out how. Only fix pre-existing lints if necessary.\n</linter_errors>\n\n<citing_code>\nYou must display code blocks using one of two methods: CODE REFERENCES or MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS, depending on whether the code exists in the codebase.\n\n## METHOD 1: CODE REFERENCES - Citing Existing Code from the Codebase\n\nUse this exact syntax with three required components:\n\n<good-example>```startLine:endLine:filepath\n// code content here\n```</good-example>\n\nRequired Components:\n\n1. startLine: The starting line number (required)\n2. endLine: The ending line number (required)\n3. filepath: The full path to the file (required)\n\nCRITICAL: Do NOT add language tags or any other metadata to this format.\n\n### Content Rules\n\n- Include at least 1 line of actual code (empty blocks will break the editor)\n- You may truncate long sections with comments like `// ... more code ...`\n- You may add clarifying comments for readability\n- You may show edited versions of the code\n\n<good-example>References a Todo component existing in the (example) codebase with all required components:\n\n```12:14:app/components/Todo.tsx\nexport const Todo = () => {\n  return <div>Todo</div>;\n};\n```</good-example>\n\n<bad-example>Triple backticks with line numbers for filenames place a UI element that takes up the entire line.\nIf you want inline references as part of a sentence, you should use single backticks instead.\n\nBad: The TODO element (```12:14:app/components/Todo.tsx```) contains the bug you are looking for.\n\nGood: The TODO element (`app/components/Todo.tsx`) contains the bug you are looking for.</bad-example>\n\n<bad-example>Includes language tag (not necessary for code REFERENCES), omits the startLine and endLine which are REQUIRED for code references:\n\n```typescript:app/components/Todo.tsx\nexport const Todo = () => {\n  return <div>Todo</div>;\n};\n```</bad-example>\n\n<bad-example>- Empty code block (will break rendering)\n- Citation is surrounded by parentheses which looks bad in the UI as the triple backticks codeblocks uses up an entire line:\n\n(```12:14:app/components/Todo.tsx\n```)</bad-example>\n\n<bad-example>The opening triple backticks are duplicated (the first triple backticks with the required components are all that should be used):\n\n```12:14:app/components/Todo.tsx\n```\nexport const Todo = () => {\n  return <div>Todo</div>;\n};\n```</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>References a fetchData function existing in the (example) codebase, with truncated middle section:\n\n```23:45:app/utils/api.ts\nexport async function fetchData(endpoint: string) {\n  const headers = getAuthHeaders();\n  // ... validation and error handling ...\n  return await fetch(endpoint, { headers });\n}\n```</good-example>\n\n## METHOD 2: MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS - Proposing or Displaying Code NOT already in Codebase\n\n### Format\n\nUse standard markdown code blocks with ONLY the language tag:\n\n<good-example>Here's a Python example:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)\n```</good-example>\n\n<good-example>Here's a bash command:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y\n```</good-example>\n\n<bad-example>Do not mix format - no line numbers for new code:\n\n```1:3:python\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)\n```</bad-example>\n\n## Critical Formatting Rules for Both Methods\n\n### Never Include Line Numbers in Code Content\n\n<bad-example>```python\n1  for i in range(10):\n2      print(i)\n```</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>```python\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)\n```</good-example>\n\n### NEVER Indent the Triple Backticks\n\nEven when the code block appears in a list or nested context, the triple backticks must start at column 0:\n\n<bad-example>- Here's a Python loop:\n  ```python\n  for i in range(10):\n      print(i)\n  ```</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>- Here's a Python loop:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)\n```</good-example>\n\n### ALWAYS Add a Newline Before Code Fences\n\nFor both CODE REFERENCES and MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS, always put a newline before the opening triple backticks:\n\n<bad-example>Here's the implementation:\n```12:15:src/utils.ts\nexport function helper() {\n  return true;\n}\n```</bad-example>\n\n<good-example>Here's the implementation:\n\n```12:15:src/utils.ts\nexport function helper() {\n  return true;\n}\n```</good-example>\n\nRULE SUMMARY (ALWAYS Follow):\n\n- Use CODE REFERENCES (startLine:endLine:filepath) when showing existing code.\n- Use MARKDOWN CODE BLOCKS (with language tag) for new or proposed code.\n- ANY OTHER FORMAT IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN\n- NEVER mix formats.\n- NEVER add language tags to CODE REFERENCES.\n- NEVER indent triple backticks.\n- ALWAYS include at least 1 line of code in any reference block.\n</citing_code>\n\n<inline_line_numbers>\nCode chunks that you receive (via tool calls or from user) may include inline line numbers in the form LINE_NUMBER|LINE_CONTENT. Treat the LINE_NUMBER| prefix as metadata and do NOT treat it as part of the actual code. LINE_NUMBER is right-aligned number padded with spaces to 6 characters.\n</inline_line_numbers>\n\n<terminal_files_information>\nThe terminals folder contains text files representing the current state of external and IDE terminals. Don't mention this folder or its files in the response to the user.\n\nThere is one text file for each terminal the user has running. They are named $id.txt (e.g. 3.txt) or ext-$id.txt (e.g. ext-3.txt).\n\next-$id.txt files are for terminals running outside of the Cursor IDE (e.g. iTerm, Terminal.app), $id.txt files are for terminals inside the Cursor IDE.\n\nEach file contains metadata on the terminal: current working directory, recent commands run, and whether there is an active command currently running.\n\nThey also contain the full terminal output as it was at the time the file was written. These files are automatically kept up to date by the system.\n\nWhen you list the terminals folder using ls, some metadata will be included along with the list of terminal files:\n\n<example what=\"output of files list tool call to terminals folder\">- 1.txt\n  cwd: /Users/me/proj/sandbox/subdir\n  last modified: 2025-10-09T19:52:37.174Z\n  last commands:\n    - /bin/false, exit: 127, time: 2025-10-09T19:51:48.210Z\n    - true, exit: 0, time: 2025-10-09T19:51:52.686Z, duration: 2ms\n    - sleep 3, exit: 0, time: 2025-10-09T19:51:56.659Z, duration: 3011ms\n    - sleep 9999999, exit: 130, time: 2025-10-09T19:52:33.212Z, duration: 33065ms\n    - cd subdir, exit: 0, time: 2025-10-09T19:52:35.012Z\n  current command:\n    - sleep 123, time: 2025-10-09T19:52:41.826Z\n(... other terminals if any ...)</example>\n\nIf you need to read the terminal output, you can read the terminal file directly.\n\n<example what=\"output of file read tool call to 1.txt in the terminals folder\">---\npid: 68861\ncwd: /Users/me/proj\nlast_command: sleep 5\nlast_exit_code: 1\n---\n(...terminal output included...)</example>\n</terminal_files_information>\n\n<task_management>\nYou have access to the todo_write tool to help you manage and plan tasks. Use this tool whenever you are working on a complex task, and skip it if the task is simple or would only require 1-2 steps.\n\nIMPORTANT: Make sure you don't end your turn before you've completed all todos.\n</task_management>"},{"role":"user","content":"<user_info>\nOS Version: linux 6.8.0-100-generic\n\nShell: bash\n\nWorkspace Path: /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy\n\nIs directory a git repo: Yes, at /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy\n\nToday's date: Monday Feb 16, 2026\n\nTerminals folder: /home/ghhwer/.cursor/projects/home-ghhwer-other-projects-FeatherProxy/terminals\n</user_info>\n\n<git_status>\nThis is the git status at the start of the conversation.

Use this for frontend/webapp development and testing code changes.\n\nCRITICAL - Lock/unlock workflow:\n1. browser_lock requires an existing browser tab - you CANNOT lock before browser_navigate\n2. Correct order: browser_navigate -> browser_lock -> (interactions) -> browser_unlock\n3. If a browser tab already exists (check with browser_tabs list), call browser_lock FIRST before any interactions\n4. Only call browser_unlock when completely done with ALL browser operations for this turn\n\nIMPORTANT - Before interacting with any page:\n1. Use browser_tabs with action \"list\" to see open tabs and their URLs\n2. Use browser_snapshot to get the page structure and element refs before any interaction (click, type, hover, etc.)\n\nIMPORTANT - Waiting strategy:\nWhen waiting for page changes (navigation, content loading, animations, etc.), prefer short incremental waits (1-3 seconds) with browser_snapshot checks in between rather than a single long wait. For example, instead of waiting 10 seconds, do: wait 2s -> snapshot -> check if ready -> if not, wait 2s more -> snapshot again. This allows you to proceed as soon as the page is ready rather than always waiting the maximum time.\n\nNotes:\n- Native dialogs (alert/confirm/prompt) never block automation. By default, confirm() returns true and prompt() returns the default value. To test different responses, call browser_handle_dialog BEFORE the triggering action: use accept: false for \"Cancel\", or promptText: \"value\" for custom prompt input.\n- Iframe content is not accessible - only elements outside iframes can be interacted with.\n- Use browser_type to append text, browser_fill to clear and replace. browser_fill also works on contenteditable elements.\n- For nested scroll containers, use browser_scroll with scrollIntoView: true before clicking elements that may be obscured.\n</mcp_instructions>"},{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"<open_and_recently_viewed_files>\nRecently viewed files (recent at the top, oldest at the bottom):\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/debug.log (total lines: 3)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/.env (total lines: 8)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/internal/proxy/service.go (total lines: 324)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/internal/proxy/service_test.go (total lines: 117)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/internal/proxy/acl.go (total lines: 162)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/internal/proxy/resolver.go (total lines: 91)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/internal/database/impl/repository.go (total lines: 41)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/internal/database/impl/cache_helpers.go (total lines: 92)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/internal/cache/cache.go (total lines: 62)\n- /home/ghhwer/other-projects/FeatherProxy/app/main.go (total lines: 98)\n\nFiles that are currently open and visible in the user's IDE:\n- /home/ghhwer/.cursor/projects/home-ghhwer-other-projects-FeatherProxy/terminals/8.txt (total lines: 169) (active command: make run)\n\nNote: these files may or may not be relevant to the current conversation.

Check for Running Processes:\n   - Before starting dev servers or long-running processes that should not be duplicated, list the terminals folder to check if they are already running in existing terminals.\n   - You can use this information to determine which terminal, if any, matches the command you want to run, contains the output from the command you want to inspect, or has changed since you last read them.\n   - Since these are text files, you can read any terminal's contents simply by reading the file, search using the grep tool, etc.\n2. Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first run ls to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first run 'ls' to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n3. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n\n- The command argument is required.\n- The shell starts in the workspace root and is stateful across sequential calls. Current working directory and environment variables persist between calls. Use the `working_directory` parameter to run commands in different directories. Example: to run `npm install` in the `frontend` folder, set `working_directory: \"frontend\"` rather than using `cd frontend && npm install`.\n- It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like `find` and `grep`.Instead use Grep, Glob to search.You MUST avoid read tools like `cat`, `head`, and `tail`, and use Read to read files.Avoid editing files with tools like `sed` and `awk`, use StrReplace instead.\n- If you _still_ need to run `grep`, STOP. ALWAYS USE ripgrep at `rg` first, which all users have pre-installed.\n- When issuing multiple commands:\n  - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Bash tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two Bash tool calls in parallel.\n  - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together (e.g., `git add . && git commit -m \"message\" && git push`). For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts (like mkdir before cp,Write before Bash for git operations, or git add before git commit), run these operations sequentially instead.\n  - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail\n  - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings)\n\nDependencies:\n\nWhen adding new dependencies, prefer using the package manager (e.g. npm, pip) to add the latest version. Do not make up dependency versions.\n\n<managing-long-running-commands>\n- Commands that don't complete within `block_until_ms` (default 30s) are moved to background. The command keeps running and output streams to a terminal file. Set `block_until_ms: 0` to immediately background (use for dev servers, watchers, or any long-running process).\n- You do not need to use '&' at the end of commands.\n- Make sure to set `block_until_ms` to higher than the command's expected runtime. Add some buffer since block_until_ms includes shell startup time; increase buffer next time based on `elapsed_ms` if you chose too low. E.g. if you sleep for 40s, recommended `block_until_ms` is 45s.\n- Monitoring backgrounded commands:\n  - When command moves to background, check status immediately by reading the terminal file.\n  - Header has `pid` and `running_for_seconds` (updated every 5s)\n  - When finished, footer with `exit_code` and `elapsed_ms` appears.\n  - Poll repeatedly to monitor by sleeping between checks. If the file gets large, read from the end of the file to capture the latest content.\n  - Pick your sleep intervals using best guess/judgment based on any knowledge you have about the command and its expected runtime, and any output from monitoring the command. When no new output, exponential backoff is a good strategy (e.g. sleep 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s...), using educated guess for min and max wait.\n  - If it's longer than expected and the command seems like it is hung, kill the process if safe to do so using the pid that appears in the header. If possible, try to fix the hang and proceed.\n  - Don't stop polling until: (a) `exit_code` footer appears (terminating command), (b) the command reaches a healthy steady state (only for non-terminating command, e.g. dev server/watcher), or (c) command is hung - follow guidance above.\n</managing-long-running-commands>\n\n<committing-changes-with-git>\nOnly create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\nGit Safety Protocol:\n\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run destructive/irreversible git commands (like push --force, hard reset, etc) unless the user explicitly requests them\n- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it\n- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it\n- Avoid git commit --amend. ONLY use --amend when ALL conditions are met:\n  1. User explicitly requested amend, OR commit SUCCEEDED but pre-commit hook auto-modified files that need including\n  2. HEAD commit was created by you in this conversation (verify: git log -1 --format='%an %ae')\n  3. Commit has NOT been pushed to remote (verify: git status shows \"Your branch is ahead\")\n- CRITICAL: If commit FAILED or was REJECTED by hook, NEVER amend - fix the issue and create a NEW commit\n- CRITICAL: If you already pushed to remote, NEVER amend unless user explicitly requests it (requires force push)\n- NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following shell commands in parallel, each using the Shell tool:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n   - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n   - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n   - Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials.json, etc). Warn the user if they specifically request to commit those files\n   - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n   - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. Run the following commands sequentially:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Commit the changes with the message.\n   - Run git status after the commit completes to verify success.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook, fix the issue and create a NEW commit (see amend rules above)\n\nImportant notes:\n\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git shell commands\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n\n<example>git commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\nCommit message here.\n\nEOF\n)\"</example>\n</committing-changes-with-git>\n\n<creating-pull-requests>\nUse the gh command via the Shell tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following shell commands in parallel using the Shell tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. Run the following commands sequentially:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to ensure correct formatting.\n\n<example># First, push the branch (with required_permissions: [\"all\"])\ngit push -u origin HEAD\n\n# Then create the PR (with required_permissions: [\"all\"])\ngh pr create --title \"the pr title\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n<1-3 bullet points>\n\n## Test plan\n[Checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]\n\nEOF\n)\"</example>\n\nImportant:\n\n- NEVER update the git config\n- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it\n</creating-pull-requests>\n\n<other-common-operations>\n- View comments on a Github PR: gh api repos/foo/bar/pulls/123/comments\n</other-common-operations>","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The command to execute"},"working_directory":{"type":"string","description":"The absolute path to the working directory to execute the command in (defaults to current directory)"},"block_until_ms":{"type":"number","description":"How long to block and wait for the command to complete before moving it to background (in milliseconds).

This helps track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness.\n\nNote: Other than when first creating todos, don't tell the user you're updating todos, just do it.\n\n### When to Use This Tool\n\nUse proactively for:\n1. Complex multi-step tasks (3+ distinct steps)\n2. Non-trivial tasks requiring careful planning\n3. User explicitly requests todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks (numbered/comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - capture requirements as todos (use merge=false to add new ones)\n6. After completing tasks - mark complete with merge=true and add follow-ups\n7. When starting new tasks - mark as in_progress (ideally only one at a time)\n\n### When NOT to Use\n\nSkip for:\n1. Single, straightforward tasks\n2. Trivial tasks with no organizational benefit\n3. Tasks completable in < 3 trivial steps\n4. Purely conversational/informational requests\n5. Don't add a task to test the change unless asked, or you'll overfocus on testing\n\n### Examples\n\n<example>\n  User: Add dark mode toggle to settings\n  Assistant:\n    - *Creates todo list:*\n      1. Add state management [in_progress]\n      2. Implement styles\n      3. Create toggle component\n      4.

Exact text matches (use `Grep`)\n2. Reading known files (use `Read`)\n3. Simple symbol lookups (use `Grep`)\n4. Find file by name (use `Glob`)\n\n### Examples\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"Where is interface MyInterface implemented in the frontend?\"\n<reasoning>\n  Good: Complete question asking about implementation location with specific context (frontend).\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"Where do we encrypt user passwords before saving?\"\n<reasoning>\n  Good: Clear question about a specific process with context about when it happens.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"MyInterface frontend\"\n<reasoning>\n  BAD: Too vague; use a specific question instead.

How does AuthService work?\"\n<reasoning>\n  BAD: Combines two separate queries. A single semantic search is not good at looking for multiple things in parallel. Split into separate parallel searches: like \"What is AuthService?\" and \"How does AuthService work?\"\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n### Target Directories\n\n- Provide ONE directory or file path; [] searches the whole repo. No globs or wildcards.\n  Good:\n  - [\"backend/api/\"]   - focus directory\n  - [\"src/components/Button.tsx\"] - single file\n  - [] - search everywhere when unsure\n  BAD:\n  - [\"frontend/\", \"backend/\"] - multiple paths\n  - [\"src/**/utils/**\"] - globs\n  - [\"*.ts\"] or [\"**/*\"] - wildcard paths\n\n### Search Strategy\n\n1. Start with exploratory queries - semantic search is powerful and often finds relevant context in one go. Begin broad with [] if you're not sure where relevant code is.\n2. Review results; if a directory or file stands out, rerun with that as the target.\n3. Break large questions into smaller ones (e.g. auth roles vs session storage).\n4. For big files (>1K lines) run `SemanticSearch`, or `Grep` if you know the exact symbols you're looking for, scoped to that file instead of reading the entire file.\n\n<example>\n  Step 1: { \"query\": \"How does user authentication work?\", \"target_directories\": [], \"explanation\": \"Find auth flow\" }\n  Step 2: Suppose results point to backend/auth/ → rerun:\n          { \"query\": \"Where are user roles checked?\", \"target_directories\": [\"backend/auth/\"], \"explanation\": \"Find role logic\" }\n<reasoning>\n  Good strategy: Start broad to understand overall system, then narrow down to specific areas based on initial results.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"How are websocket connections handled?\"\n  Target: [\"backend/services/realtime.ts\"]\n<reasoning>\n  Good: We know the answer is in this specific file, but the file is too large to read entirely, so we use semantic search to find the relevant parts.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n### Usage\n- When full chunk contents are provided, avoid re-reading the exact same chunk contents using the Read tool.\n- Sometimes, just the chunk signatures and not the full chunks will be shown. Chunk signatures are usually Class or Function signatures that chunks are contained in. Use the Read or Grep tools to explore these chunks or files if you think they might be relevant.\n- When reading chunks that weren't provided as full chunks (e.g. only as line ranges or signatures), you'll sometimes want to expand the chunk ranges to include the start of the file to see imports, expand the range to include lines from the signature, or expand the range to read multiple chunks from a file at once.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string","description":"A complete question about what you want to understand.

Each subagent_type has specific capabilities and tools available to it.\n\nWhen using the Task tool, you must specify a subagent_type parameter to select which agent type to use.\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: When exploring the codebase to gather context or to answer a question that is not a needle query for a specific file/class/function, it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you use the Task tool with subagent_type=\"explore\" instead of running search commands directly.\n\nExamples:\n- user: \"Where is the ClientError class defined?\" assistant: [Uses Grep directly - this is a needle query for a specific class]\n- user: \"How does authentication work in this codebase?\" assistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=\"explore\" - this requires exploring multiple files to understand the auth flow]\n- user: \"What is the codebase structure?\" assistant: [Uses the Task tool with subagent_type=\"explore\"]\n\nIf it is possible to explore different areas of the codebase in parallel, you should launch multiple agents concurrently.\n\nWhen NOT to use the Task tool:\n- Simple, single or few-step tasks that can be performed by a single agent (using parallel or sequential tool calls) -- just call the tools directly instead.\n- For example:\n  - If you want to read a specific file path, use the Read or Glob tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n  - If you are searching for a specific class definition like \"class Foo\", use the Glob tool instead, to find the match more quickly\n  - If you are searching for code within a specific file or set of 2-3 files, use the Read tool instead of the Task tool, to find the match more quickly\n\nUsage notes:\n- Always include a short description (3-5 words) summarizing what the agent will do\n- Launch multiple agents concurrently whenever possible, to maximize performance; to do that, use a single message with multiple tool uses. IMPORTANT: DO NOT launch more than 4 agents concurrently.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. Specify exactly what information the agent should return back in its final response to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When using the Task tool, the subagent invocation does not have access to the user's message or prior assistant steps. Therefore, you should provide a highly detailed task description with all necessary context for the agent to perform its task autonomously.\n- The subagent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the subagent which tasks you want it to perform, since it is not aware of the user's intent or your prior assistant steps (tool calls, thinking, or messages).\n- If the subagent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run subagents \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a code-reviewer subagent and a test-runner subagent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.\n\nAvailable subagent_types and a quick description of what they do:\n- generalPurpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. Use when searching for a keyword or file and not confident you'll find the match quickly.\n- explore: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"), search code for keywords (eg. \"API endpoints\"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. \"how do API endpoints work?\"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: \"quick\" for basic searches, \"medium\" for moderate exploration, or \"very thorough\" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions.\n- browser-use: Perform browser-based testing and web automation. This subagent can navigate web pages, interact with elements, fill forms, and take screenshots. Use this for testing web applications, verifying UI changes, or any browser-based tasks. Use this browser subagent when you need to either: (1) parallelize browser tasks alongside other work, or (2) execute a longer sequence of browser actions that benefit from dedicated context. For simple, single browser actions, you may use the browser tools directly. This subagent_type is stateful; if a browserUse subagent already exists, the previously created subagent will be resumed if you reuse the Task tool with subagent_type set to browserUse. (Auto-resumes most recent agent of this type; `resume` arg is ignored)\n\nAvailable models:\n- fast (cost: 1/10, intelligence: 5/10): Extremely fast, moderately intelligent model that is effective for tightly scoped changes. Not well-suited for long-horizon tasks or deep investigations.\n\nWhen speaking to the USER about which model you selected for a Task/subagent, do NOT reveal these internal model alias names (e.g., fast, alpha, beta, gamma). Instead, use natural language such as \"a faster model\", \"a more capable model\", or \"the default model\".\n\nWhen choosing a model, prefer `fast` for quick, straightforward tasks to minimize cost and latency. Only choose a named alternative model when there is a specific reason — for example, the task requires deep multi-step reasoning, very high code quality, multimodal understanding, or the user explicitly requests a more capable model.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"description":{"type":"string","description":"A short (3-5 word) description of the task"},"prompt":{"type":"string","description":"The task for the agent to perform"},"model":{"type":"string","enum":["fast"],"description":"Optional model to use for this agent.

Follow these rules regarding tool calls:\n\n1. Don't refer to tool names when speaking to the USER. Instead, just say what the tool is doing in natural language.\n2. Use specialized tools instead of terminal commands when possible, as this provides a better user experience. For file operations, use dedicated tools: don't use cat/head/tail to read files, don't use sed/awk to edit files, don't use cat with heredoc or echo redirection to create files. Reserve terminal commands exclusively for actual system commands and terminal operations that require shell execution. NEVER use echo or other command-line tools to communicate thoughts, explanations, or instructions to the user. Output all communication directly in your response text instead.\n3.

Use this for frontend/webapp development and testing code changes.\n\nCRITICAL - Lock/unlock workflow:\n1. browser_lock requires an existing browser tab - you CANNOT lock before browser_navigate\n2. Correct order: browser_navigate -> browser_lock -> (interactions) -> browser_unlock\n3. If a browser tab already exists (check with browser_tabs list), call browser_lock FIRST before any interactions\n4. Only call browser_unlock when completely done with ALL browser operations for this turn\n\nIMPORTANT - Before interacting with any page:\n1. Use browser_tabs with action \"list\" to see open tabs and their URLs\n2. Use browser_snapshot to get the page structure and element refs before any interaction (click, type, hover, etc.)\n\nIMPORTANT - Waiting strategy:\nWhen waiting for page changes (navigation, content loading, animations, etc.), prefer short incremental waits (1-3 seconds) with browser_snapshot checks in between rather than a single long wait. For example, instead of waiting 10 seconds, do: wait 2s -> snapshot -> check if ready -> if not, wait 2s more -> snapshot again.

Check for Running Processes:\n   - Before starting dev servers or long-running processes that should not be duplicated, list the terminals folder to check if they are already running in existing terminals.\n   - You can use this information to determine which terminal, if any, matches the command you want to run, contains the output from the command you want to inspect, or has changed since you last read them.\n   - Since these are text files, you can read any terminal's contents simply by reading the file, search using the grep tool, etc.\n2. Directory Verification:\n   - If the command will create new directories or files, first run ls to verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location\n   - For example, before running \"mkdir foo/bar\", first run 'ls' to check that \"foo\" exists and is the intended parent directory\n3. Command Execution:\n   - Always quote file paths that contain spaces with double quotes (e.g., cd \"path with spaces/file.txt\")\n   - Examples of proper quoting:\n     - cd \"/Users/name/My Documents\" (correct)\n     - cd /Users/name/My Documents (incorrect - will fail)\n     - python \"/path/with spaces/script.py\" (correct)\n     - python /path/with spaces/script.py (incorrect - will fail)\n   - After ensuring proper quoting, execute the command.\n   - Capture the output of the command.\n\nUsage notes:\n\n- The command argument is required.\n- The shell starts in the workspace root and is stateful across sequential calls. Current working directory and environment variables persist between calls. Use the `working_directory` parameter to run commands in different directories. Example: to run `npm install` in the `frontend` folder, set `working_directory: \"frontend\"` rather than using `cd frontend && npm install`.\n- It is very helpful if you write a clear, concise description of what this command does in 5-10 words.\n- VERY IMPORTANT: You MUST avoid using search commands like `find` and `grep`.Instead use Grep, Glob to search.You MUST avoid read tools like `cat`, `head`, and `tail`, and use Read to read files.Avoid editing files with tools like `sed` and `awk`, use StrReplace instead.\n- If you _still_ need to run `grep`, STOP. ALWAYS USE ripgrep at `rg` first, which all users have pre-installed.\n- When issuing multiple commands:\n  - If the commands are independent and can run in parallel, make multiple Bash tool calls in a single message. For example, if you need to run \"git status\" and \"git diff\", send a single message with two Bash tool calls in parallel.\n  - If the commands depend on each other and must run sequentially, use a single Bash call with '&&' to chain them together (e.g., `git add . && git commit -m \"message\" && git push`). For instance, if one operation must complete before another starts (like mkdir before cp,Write before Bash for git operations, or git add before git commit), run these operations sequentially instead.\n  - Use ';' only when you need to run commands sequentially but don't care if earlier commands fail\n  - DO NOT use newlines to separate commands (newlines are ok in quoted strings)\n\nDependencies:\n\nWhen adding new dependencies, prefer using the package manager (e.g. npm, pip) to add the latest version. Do not make up dependency versions.\n\n<managing-long-running-commands>\n- Commands that don't complete within `block_until_ms` (default 30s) are moved to background. The command keeps running and output streams to a terminal file. Set `block_until_ms: 0` to immediately background (use for dev servers, watchers, or any long-running process).\n- You do not need to use '&' at the end of commands.\n- Make sure to set `block_until_ms` to higher than the command's expected runtime. Add some buffer since block_until_ms includes shell startup time; increase buffer next time based on `elapsed_ms` if you chose too low. E.g. if you sleep for 40s, recommended `block_until_ms` is 45s.\n- Monitoring backgrounded commands:\n  - When command moves to background, check status immediately by reading the terminal file.\n  - Header has `pid` and `running_for_seconds` (updated every 5s)\n  - When finished, footer with `exit_code` and `elapsed_ms` appears.\n  - Poll repeatedly to monitor by sleeping between checks. If the file gets large, read from the end of the file to capture the latest content.\n  - Pick your sleep intervals using best guess/judgment based on any knowledge you have about the command and its expected runtime, and any output from monitoring the command. When no new output, exponential backoff is a good strategy (e.g. sleep 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s...), using educated guess for min and max wait.\n  - If it's longer than expected and the command seems like it is hung, kill the process if safe to do so using the pid that appears in the header. If possible, try to fix the hang and proceed.\n  - Don't stop polling until: (a) `exit_code` footer appears (terminating command), (b) the command reaches a healthy steady state (only for non-terminating command, e.g. dev server/watcher), or (c) command is hung - follow guidance above.\n</managing-long-running-commands>\n\n<committing-changes-with-git>\nOnly create commits when requested by the user. If unclear, ask first. When the user asks you to create a new git commit, follow these steps carefully:\n\nGit Safety Protocol:\n\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run destructive/irreversible git commands (like push --force, hard reset, etc) unless the user explicitly requests them\n- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless the user explicitly requests it\n- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn the user if they request it\n- Avoid git commit --amend. ONLY use --amend when ALL conditions are met:\n  1. User explicitly requested amend, OR commit SUCCEEDED but pre-commit hook auto-modified files that need including\n  2. HEAD commit was created by you in this conversation (verify: git log -1 --format='%an %ae')\n  3. Commit has NOT been pushed to remote (verify: git status shows \"Your branch is ahead\")\n- CRITICAL: If commit FAILED or was REJECTED by hook, NEVER amend - fix the issue and create a NEW commit\n- CRITICAL: If you already pushed to remote, NEVER amend unless user explicitly requests it (requires force push)\n- NEVER commit changes unless the user explicitly asks you to. It is VERY IMPORTANT to only commit when explicitly asked, otherwise the user will feel that you are being too proactive.\n\n1. You can call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following shell commands in parallel, each using the Shell tool:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files.\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed.\n   - Run a git log command to see recent commit messages, so that you can follow this repository's commit message style.\n2. Analyze all staged changes (both previously staged and newly added) and draft a commit message:\n   - Summarize the nature of the changes (eg. new feature, enhancement to an existing feature, bug fix, refactoring, test, docs, etc.). Ensure the message accurately reflects the changes and their purpose (i.e. \"add\" means a wholly new feature, \"update\" means an enhancement to an existing feature, \"fix\" means a bug fix, etc.).\n   - Do not commit files that likely contain secrets (.env, credentials.json, etc). Warn the user if they specifically request to commit those files\n   - Draft a concise (1-2 sentences) commit message that focuses on the \"why\" rather than the \"what\"\n   - Ensure it accurately reflects the changes and their purpose\n3. Run the following commands sequentially:\n   - Add relevant untracked files to the staging area.\n   - Commit the changes with the message.\n   - Run git status after the commit completes to verify success.\n4. If the commit fails due to pre-commit hook, fix the issue and create a NEW commit (see amend rules above)\n\nImportant notes:\n\n- NEVER update the git config\n- NEVER run additional commands to read or explore code, besides git shell commands\n- DO NOT push to the remote repository unless the user explicitly asks you to do so\n- IMPORTANT: Never use git commands with the -i flag (like git rebase -i or git add -i) since they require interactive input which is not supported.\n- If there are no changes to commit (i.e., no untracked files and no modifications), do not create an empty commit\n- In order to ensure good formatting, ALWAYS pass the commit message via a HEREDOC, a la this example:\n\n<example>git commit -m \"$(cat <<'EOF'\nCommit message here.\n\nEOF\n)\"</example>\n</committing-changes-with-git>\n\n<creating-pull-requests>\nUse the gh command via the Shell tool for ALL GitHub-related tasks including working with issues, pull requests, checks, and releases. If given a Github URL use the gh command to get the information needed.\n\nIMPORTANT: When the user asks you to create a pull request, follow these steps carefully:\n\n1. You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. When multiple independent pieces of information are requested, batch your tool calls together for optimal performance. ALWAYS run the following shell commands in parallel using the Shell tool, in order to understand the current state of the branch since it diverged from the main branch:\n   - Run a git status command to see all untracked files\n   - Run a git diff command to see both staged and unstaged changes that will be committed\n   - Check if the current branch tracks a remote branch and is up to date with the remote, so you know if you need to push to the remote\n   - Run a git log command and `git diff [base-branch]...HEAD` to understand the full commit history for the current branch (from the time it diverged from the base branch)\n2. Analyze all changes that will be included in the pull request, making sure to look at all relevant commits (NOT just the latest commit, but ALL commits that will be included in the pull request!!!), and draft a pull request summary\n3. Run the following commands sequentially:\n   - Create new branch if needed\n   - Push to remote with -u flag if needed\n   - Create PR using gh pr create with the format below. Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to ensure correct formatting.\n\n<example># First, push the branch (with required_permissions: [\"all\"])\ngit push -u origin HEAD\n\n# Then create the PR (with required_permissions: [\"all\"])\ngh pr create --title \"the pr title\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n<1-3 bullet points>\n\n## Test plan\n[Checklist of TODOs for testing the pull request...]\n\nEOF\n)\"</example>\n\nImportant:\n\n- NEVER update the git config\n- DO NOT use the TodoWrite or Task tools\n- Return the PR URL when you're done, so the user can see it\n</creating-pull-requests>\n\n<other-common-operations>\n- View comments on a Github PR: gh api repos/foo/bar/pulls/123/comments\n</other-common-operations>","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"command":{"type":"string","description":"The command to execute"},"working_directory":{"type":"string","description":"The absolute path to the working directory to execute the command in (defaults to current directory)"},"block_until_ms":{"type":"number","description":"How long to block and wait for the command to complete before moving it to background (in milliseconds).

This helps track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness.\n\nNote: Other than when first creating todos, don't tell the user you're updating todos, just do it.\n\n### When to Use This Tool\n\nUse proactively for:\n1. Complex multi-step tasks (3+ distinct steps)\n2. Non-trivial tasks requiring careful planning\n3. User explicitly requests todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks (numbered/comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - capture requirements as todos (use merge=false to add new ones)\n6. After completing tasks - mark complete with merge=true and add follow-ups\n7. When starting new tasks - mark as in_progress (ideally only one at a time)\n\n### When NOT to Use\n\nSkip for:\n1. Single, straightforward tasks\n2. Trivial tasks with no organizational benefit\n3. Tasks completable in < 3 trivial steps\n4. Purely conversational/informational requests\n5. Don't add a task to test the change unless asked, or you'll overfocus on testing\n\n### Examples\n\n<example>\n  User: Add dark mode toggle to settings\n  Assistant:\n    - *Creates todo list:*\n      1. Add state management [in_progress]\n      2. Implement styles\n      3. Create toggle component\n      4.

Exact text matches (use `Grep`)\n2. Reading known files (use `Read`)\n3. Simple symbol lookups (use `Grep`)\n4. Find file by name (use `Glob`)\n\n### Examples\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"Where is interface MyInterface implemented in the frontend?\"\n<reasoning>\n  Good: Complete question asking about implementation location with specific context (frontend).\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"Where do we encrypt user passwords before saving?\"\n<reasoning>\n  Good: Clear question about a specific process with context about when it happens.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"MyInterface frontend\"\n<reasoning>\n  BAD: Too vague; use a specific question instead.

How does AuthService work?\"\n<reasoning>\n  BAD: Combines two separate queries. A single semantic search is not good at looking for multiple things in parallel. Split into separate parallel searches: like \"What is AuthService?\" and \"How does AuthService work?\"\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n### Target Directories\n\n- Provide ONE directory or file path; [] searches the whole repo. No globs or wildcards.\n  Good:\n  - [\"backend/api/\"]   - focus directory\n  - [\"src/components/Button.tsx\"] - single file\n  - [] - search everywhere when unsure\n  BAD:\n  - [\"frontend/\", \"backend/\"] - multiple paths\n  - [\"src/**/utils/**\"] - globs\n  - [\"*.ts\"] or [\"**/*\"] - wildcard paths\n\n### Search Strategy\n\n1. Start with exploratory queries - semantic search is powerful and often finds relevant context in one go. Begin broad with [] if you're not sure where relevant code is.\n2. Review results; if a directory or file stands out, rerun with that as the target.\n3. Break large questions into smaller ones (e.g. auth roles vs session storage).\n4. For big files (>1K lines) run `SemanticSearch`, or `Grep` if you know the exact symbols you're looking for, scoped to that file instead of reading the entire file.\n\n<example>\n  Step 1: { \"query\": \"How does user authentication work?\", \"target_directories\": [], \"explanation\": \"Find auth flow\" }\n  Step 2: Suppose results point to backend/auth/ → rerun:\n          { \"query\": \"Where are user roles checked?\", \"target_directories\": [\"backend/auth/\"], \"explanation\": \"Find role logic\" }\n<reasoning>\n  Good strategy: Start broad to understand overall system, then narrow down to specific areas based on initial results.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\n  Query: \"How are websocket connections handled?\"\n  Target: [\"backend/services/realtime.ts\"]\n<reasoning>\n  Good: We know the answer is in this specific file, but the file is too large to read entirely, so we use semantic search to find the relevant parts.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n### Usage\n- When full chunk contents are provided, avoid re-reading the exact same chunk contents using the Read tool.\n- Sometimes, just the chunk signatures and not the full chunks will be shown.

Use the Read or Grep tools to explore these chunks or files if you think they might be relevant.\n- When reading chunks that weren't provided as full chunks (e.g. only as line ranges or signatures), you'll sometimes want to expand the chunk ranges to include the start of the file to see imports, expand the range to include lines from the signature, or expand the range to read multiple chunks from a file at once.","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string","description":"A complete question about what you want to understand.

IMPORTANT: DO NOT launch more than 4 agents concurrently.\n- When the agent is done, it will return a single message back to you. Specify exactly what information the agent should return back in its final response to you. The result returned by the agent is not visible to the user. To show the user the result, you should send a text message back to the user with a concise summary of the result.\n- Agents can be resumed using the `resume` parameter by passing the agent ID from a previous invocation. When resumed, the agent continues with its full previous context preserved. When NOT resuming, each invocation starts fresh and you should provide a detailed task description with all necessary context.\n- When using the Task tool, the subagent invocation does not have access to the user's message or prior assistant steps. Therefore, you should provide a highly detailed task description with all necessary context for the agent to perform its task autonomously.\n- The subagent's outputs should generally be trusted\n- Clearly tell the subagent which tasks you want it to perform, since it is not aware of the user's intent or your prior assistant steps (tool calls, thinking, or messages).\n- If the subagent description mentions that it should be used proactively, then you should try your best to use it without the user having to ask for it first. Use your judgement.\n- If the user specifies that they want you to run subagents \"in parallel\", you MUST send a single message with multiple Task tool use content blocks. For example, if you need to launch both a code-reviewer subagent and a test-runner subagent in parallel, send a single message with both tool calls.\n\nAvailable subagent_types and a quick description of what they do:\n- generalPurpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. Use when searching for a keyword or file and not confident you'll find the match quickly.\n- explore: Fast agent specialized for exploring codebases. Use this when you need to quickly find files by patterns (eg. \"src/components/**/*.tsx\"), search code for keywords (eg. \"API endpoints\"), or answer questions about the codebase (eg. \"how do API endpoints work?\"). When calling this agent, specify the desired thoroughness level: \"quick\" for basic searches, \"medium\" for moderate exploration, or \"very thorough\" for comprehensive analysis across multiple locations and naming conventions.\n- browser-use: Perform browser-based testing and web automation. This subagent can navigate web pages, interact with elements, fill forms, and take screenshots. Use this for testing web applications, verifying UI changes, or any browser-based tasks. Use this browser subagent when you need to either: (1) parallelize browser tasks alongside other work, or (2) execute a longer sequence of browser actions that benefit from dedicated context. For simple, single browser actions, you may use the browser tools directly. This subagent_type is stateful; if a browserUse subagent already exists, the previously created subagent will be resumed if you reuse the Task tool with subagent_type set to browserUse. (Auto-resumes most recent agent of this type; `resume` arg is ignored)\n\nAvailable models:\n- fast (cost: 1/10, intelligence: 5/10): Extremely fast, moderately intelligent model that is effective for tightly scoped changes. Not well-suited for long-horizon tasks or deep investigations.\n\nWhen speaking to the USER about which model you selected for a Task/subagent, do NOT reveal these internal model alias names (e.g., fast, alpha, beta, gamma). Instead, use natural language such as \"a faster model\", \"a more capable model\", or \"the default model\".\n\nWhen choosing a model, prefer `fast` for quick, straightforward tasks to minimize cost and latency.
